	    	<p>My development website is centered around generating Spring Weekend
        Lineups! Because of COVID, it is very unlikely we will get a Spring
        Weekend from the school. To make up for this, we can at least make our
        own lineups and imagine what the best weekend at Brown could have been
        like. The vast majority of the student population has no idea what the
        process is like for selecting or budgeting, so this is just a guess at what
        budget and selection would look like. You can select up to six artists to
        have in your lineup, and you will get metrics such as total cost and
        crowd approval based on the artists you selected. Once you have generated
        a lineup, you can save it so you can compare crowd approvals of the
        different lineups you can think up!</p>

	    	<h2 class="text-center mb-3">Usability Principles</h2>
	    	<p>For my usability, I made sure that interactable objects and dropdowns
        were clearly marked. Buttons have distinct and vibrant colors, and sorting
        dropdowns arrows that indicate they have more information. For Colors,
        I chose a dark design, with light and muted accents for readablity.
        I also designed this to be a one page site, that when looking at each
        section, can be read in order from left to right, with increasing information
        as you scroll down the screen. This is to adhere to natural reading and
        gazing tendencies of users.

	    	<p>React is very powerful when dealing with Stateful webpages! If
        something is changing based on user actions, I should think about using
        React.</p>
